Used strings command to view the readable content and found a base64 encoded string. 
Decoding the base64 string showed a link to a github gist. 
In that a file was present which i presumed was ascii but after trying to decode it 
with python using octal ascii. The output wasnt still decipherable. 
Tried finding different ways to decipher or do it and gave up.
