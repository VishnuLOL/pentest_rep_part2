Tried running the program in the terminal and found out that it randomly asked base64, 
rot13, binary, octal etc... So knew i had to find a way to automate bash with python with 
pwntools library.
I tried without using pwntools using the connect function and all. But didnt seem to click. 
Then looked at the pwntools library. Found that it had base64 and respective 
command in a single line for easier user interface.
After using a lot of my brain cells and burning my head i came to the 
conclusion that I wasnt upto that level. So i tried using the script on one terminal 
and python on the other and did the first level
But then there was a second level!!! The next level had some kind of secret to it 
because everytime it gave wrong answer and exited. So i gave up on this challenge.
