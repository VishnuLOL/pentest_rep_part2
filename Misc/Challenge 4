I knew it was base64 encoding after seeing the equal to(=) sign at the end. 
As per the challenge it was encrypted multiple times using the same encrypting pattern.
So I wrote a program in python to repeatedly decode the text inputted by the file and 
run it through a loop and decode it and then print the final product.
So all i had to do was give the number of times the loop is gonna run. 
Then after a lot of trial and error i found out that it was encrypted for 35 times and 
it was a python scipt to encrypt the flag using rot13 and find if user inputs the same flag.
After getting the code I just found out what the flag was by using print(x) to the code and reversing rot13.
