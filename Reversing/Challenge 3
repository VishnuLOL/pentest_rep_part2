I used file command to view the type of file. Found out it was ELF. Changed its execution mode using chmod
Tried executing using ./conditional. Showed the usage prompt. Used ./conditional paXword. Didnt work.
Then used ghidra to reverse engineer. Found the main function and in it was a password verification code
which returns the flag if the password was right. To find the password we had to look at another function.
But its just gibberish and doesnt give anything. So went to the getFlag function and found an algorithm.
Changed the hex to decimal and changed some code and used the code to give the flag without going through
the password finding phase.
Screenshots are given in the resources folder.
