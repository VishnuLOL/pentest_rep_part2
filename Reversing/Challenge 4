Used file to view type. Found it was ELF. Used strings command to view readable words. Found out it 
is to be used as ./rev_challenge_4 <password>.Used chmod 777 and tried to use a random password. Didnt work.
So opened ghidra to check the code. From the main function code it is certain that the password should be 10 letters
long and should have '@' in its fourth position. While trying random strings i got the respective flag. So
the flag is in the format 'flag{____@_____}'.
Screenshots are given in the resources tab.
