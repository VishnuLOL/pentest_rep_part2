Using strings on the pyc file shows a rather odd string. Without further context i tried using python3 to run
the chall.pyc file. It didnt work and showed an error that it was bad magic number. After some digging i found 
that the pyc file had to run with specific versions of python for it to function properly. So i found out its magic number
and corresponded it to the version and found out it ran in python2.7 So i used python2 and then it asked for a string
I used the one got from the strings command but it was not right and even gave syntax error. So after a lot 
of looking into it I knew i had to uncompyle it and i tried with uncompyle6 and decompyle3. Then i found out for python2.7
uncompyle2 was to be used. I uncompyled with it and got a file. Viewed the file to see a python code.
Then got the logic of the code down and reversed the logic to get the flag. Then ran the code again with the 
gotten flag and it returned true.
